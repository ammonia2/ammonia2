## Current Focus

I'm currently exploring the intersection of systems programming and modern web technologies, with a particular interest in performance optimization and creating efficient, scalable solutions.
Besides this, I am actively learning about Transformers, Fine-tuning architectures, Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning.


*Always open to collaborating on interesting projects and learning new technologies!*
